I enjoy working on projects that fuse art and computer science with some Physics applications. For the past three years I'm learning theory deeply and practicing problems for a better understanding of the subject. Also I'm practicing to get comfortable with long & complex mathematical calculations to interpret its physical meaning. I'm interested in technology and how it has shaped the world and how it plays the great part adavancing the present physics application. But it can't get better on its own so I want to be a part of the process which is doing so. I believe using technology and Physics, we can form a bridge so that one can appreicate the beauty of Physics.\n\n# Currently\n\nCurrently I am completing my Masters in Physics from Hindu College, University of Delhi, New Delhi, India. I had successfully completed my Bachelors of Science (Honours) in Physics from Hindu College, University of Delhi as well. I am good in the numerical techniques especially in programming environments of C/C++, fortran and software like Scilab and currently learning HTML, CSS and Javascripts alongwith softwares like Matlab. Also summer projects helped me understand the code regardless of the language.\n\n# Some history\n\n- Just trying to complete the website first.\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Cats\n- Space\n- Coding\n- Physics\n- Summer\n- Star Wars\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I almost always have a pocket notebook but I havn't filled two pages so far. (One day, I will.)\n- I have a list of thousands of ideas, like creating a manual to make your cat like you.\n- Sometimes I draw worst sketches of people around me.\n- I can't locate every state on a map.\n- I lie sometimes.\n- I added this page otherwise my site was just my resume.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- Always finding inspiration.\n- Enabling a brighter future.\n- Sleeping a little less.\n- Going to Mars.\n- Doing better.\n\n\n# Great people I admire\n\n- [Ratan N.
